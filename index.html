                The history of forts in India through the medieval era is a harmonious continuation of its past. <br>

                Architectural changes reflected the changing atmosphere of the country.<br>
                The forts were constructed in order to influence the people,showcase the wealth,power and glory of a king.
                <br>Most of the forts were actually castles.Most of the forts were constructed between 1300-1800A.D.
                <br>Forts today are seen as the tangible reminders of the military might of the kingdoms of the past.
                <br>The forts of the subcontinent as well as those that travelled from far off lands along with conquerers and adventurers.

         Being surrounded by high walls on all sides,it was strategically planned so as to make the enemies think twice before they attacked.
         <br>Strongly guarded by a triple gate beyond the summit of the Rajagiri could not have been easily attacked by any enemies.
         <br>Today,however,the summit can be reached after a two hour trek; strenous, but well worth the effort.</a>
